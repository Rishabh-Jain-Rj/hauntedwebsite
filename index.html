                Many years ago, a mother buys her daughter a doll to bring with her to college. I guess so she has something that makes her think about home and to comfort her.<br><br>

                The girl of course brings the doll with her to college and places it in a chair of some sort. In the dorm room.<br><br>
                
                One day, when the girl and her roommate came home they met a sight they would have never imagined could be true.. The doll had moved.. the girls were the only ones with the key to the room.. Who or what moved the doll?<br><br>
                
                Well the girls didn’t think much about it and put the doll back in the chair and forgot about it.<br><br>
                
                The next day the girls, have to run some errands.<br><br>
                
                They come back later that day. And once AGAIN! The doll had moved?<br><br>
                
                But not just a little bit.. the doll was in a completely different room… :-O<br><br>
                
                Again no one had access to the room.!<br><br>
                
                Very mysterious and creepy..<br><br>
                
                Anyway some time passes, and the girls keep on experiencing creepy things in the apartment.<br><br>
                
                One night the girl and her roommate came home to find the doll laying in her bed.. COVERED IN BLOOD.. nobody knows whose blood?<br><br>
                
                It seemed like the blood came from the doll!<br><br>
                
                Anyway the girls had had enough. They called experts and had them look at the doll for them.<br><br>
                
                They called the local famous couple (Ed and Lorraine warren) depicted in “the conjuring”.<br><br>
                
                They determined that the doll was no ghost. But possessed by an evil demon?<br><br>
                
                The couple agreed to get rid of the doll for them. They put it in a bag.. and began the drive home.. But here is where it got weird.. when they drove home. The engine kept going out, the power steering kept failing? :-O<br>
                <br>
                Even the brakes gave them trouble..<br><br>
                
                They sprayed the doll with holy water. And it stopped.. (for a while)<br><br>
                
                Then she began doing weird things again. And they called in a priest to help them..<br><br>
                
                He looked at the doll and said “you're just a doll. You can't hurt anybody”<br><br>
                
                He was trying to confront the demon, and explain to it. That it didn’t belong here. And that they weren’t afraid of it.<br><br>
                
                That was a mistake, on the way home, he crashed in a horrible car accident. But survived..<br><br>
                
                Eventually the couple built a case for the doll.. where it's still placed to this day.. you can even come visit it..<br><br>
                
                (The museum is in the warrens backyard.<br><br>
                
                It’s a part of their house. And the Annabelle doll has been there for many years.)<br><br>
                
                There was another incident during the time when the museum had guests come see the doll regularly.<br><br>
                
                Something strange once happened. Again something unexplainable.<br><br>
                
                A young couple visited the museum. They got the regular tour. And saw the different artifacts the warrens had collected from their many visits to strange houses.<br><br>
                
                On the glass cage where the Annabelle doll is protected in. (Or rather locked up to protect us!)<br><br>
                
                There is a sign that says “don’t touch the glass!”<br><br>
                
                It's strictly forbidden to touch the glass cage… in case of a curse or whatever.<br><br>
                
                But the young couple didn't care.. they touched the glass case. And laughed and pointed at the doll…
                <br><br>
                That was stupid.. on their way home.. (they were riding on a motorcycle) they crashed horribly.. the girl died instantly. And the guy was in a coma for 1 year…. Sounds strange? It is!!
                <br><br>
                The case freaks me out.. and it's when I read those things I start to question what's real and what's not… if you don't believe me you can read all this on google.. it's easy to find..<br>
                <br>
                I read somewhere that apparently the dorm-room where the girl lived. There was once a house, where a little girl died. And they think she is the one who possessed the doll.. but why she was evil no one knows…
                <br><br>
                You can see Lorraine warren on YouTube in front of the doll in her museum talking about the doll. And refusing to even look at the doll. She says it’s the most evil thing to ever exist on this earth.
                <br><br>
                And it must never get out of the case.
                <br><br>
                Check out the video! She is clearly disturbed by the doll and has witnessed it’s evil past..
                <br><br>
                There is also a video where the doll has to be moved into a more secure case.
                <br><br>
                It’s kinda spooky to look at. The men are clearly scared of it.
                <br><br>
                And a priest regularly comes by to say prayers and holy water is sprayed in the room and the guy who moved the doll in the video wears massive gloves so he doesn’t have contact with the doll.
                <br><br>
                (Noone can touch it with their bare hands!)
                <br><br>
                It’s extremely creepy!
                <br><br>
                All the videos are on YouTube.
                <br><br>
                Very creepy and so is the movie..
